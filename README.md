# bc-comm-right-click

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>By default, the development environment that the <a href="https://forum.bigcommerce.com">BigCommerce Community</a> page is built with does not allow users to open links in a new tab.</p>
<p>This script has the very simple purpose of allowing users to open links in a new tab.</p>
<p>As this is still in its beginning stages, the only links targeted by this script are located under the "Recent Activity" section.</p>
<p>Please note that ctrl-clicking does not currently work in Firefox for Windows.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To use this script, do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">Greasemonkey</a> (Firefox Extension) or <a href="http://tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> (Chrome Extension).</li>
<li>Install script from <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/20808-bc-recent-activity-links-open-in-new-tab">this page</a>.</li>
