# bc-community-right-click

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>By default, the development environment that the <a href="https://forum.bigcommerce.com">BigCommerce Community</a> page is built with does not allow users to open links in a new tab.</p>
<p>This script has the very simple purpose of allowing users to open links in a new tab.</p>
<p>As this is still in its beginning stages, the only links targeted by this script are located under the "Recent Activity" section.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that ctrl-clicking does not currently work in Firefox for Windows.</strong></p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To use this script, do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">Greasemonkey</a> (Firefox Extension) or <a href="http://tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> (Chrome Extension).</li>
<li>Install script from <a href="https://github.com/Bairdley/bc-community-right-click/raw/master/bc-community-new-tab.user.js">this link</a>.</li>

</ol>
